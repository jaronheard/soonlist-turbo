## Red Flags to Watch For
- ðŸš¨ "Network request failed" errors
- ðŸš¨ Events not syncing between devices
- ðŸš¨ Authentication loops
- ðŸš¨ Missing historical data
- ðŸš¨ Slow performance vs previous version
- ðŸš¨ Push notifications not arriving
- ðŸš¨ Workflow status stuck in "processing"

## Rollback Criteria
Consider rolling back if:
- Authentication is broken for > 5% of users
- Event creation fails > 10% of the time
- Real-time sync is not working
- Critical data loss detected
- Performance degraded > 50%
