### Phase 7: Final Verification (30 minutes)
**Goal: Production readiness check**

18. **Configuration Audit**
    - Verify all production endpoints
    - Check for debug code
    - Confirm analytics working

19. **Regression Check**
    - Compare with previous version
    - Verify nothing broken

20. **Documentation**
    - Screenshot any issues
    - Note performance metrics
    - Document workarounds

## Total Time: ~5.5 hours

## Testing Tips

### Device Setup
- Use at least 2 different iPhone models
- Test on oldest supported iOS (15.1)
- Test on latest iOS version
- Have one device on WiFi, one on cellular

### Account Preparation
- Existing user with lots of events
- New user account
- Guest testing capability
- Test event sources ready

### Monitoring During Testing
- Keep Convex dashboard open
- Watch for console errors in Xcode
- Monitor Sentry for new issues
- Check OneSignal delivery

### Issue Tracking
Create tickets for:
- ðŸ”´ Critical: Blocks core functionality
- ðŸŸ¡ Major: Significant UX impact
- ðŸŸ¢ Minor: Polish issues

### When to Stop Testing
Stop and fix if you find:
- Authentication failures
- Data loss
- Sync not working
- Consistent crashes
- Major performance regression

## Quick Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue | Impact | Rollback? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Auth broken | All users | Yes - Immediate |
| Sync failing | All users | Yes - Immediate |
| AI extraction down | New events only | No - Can fix live |
| Push notifications down | Engagement | No - Can fix live |
| Share extension broken | Convenience | No - Can fix in update |
| Performance 2x slower | UX | Maybe - Monitor |
| Specific crash scenario | Some users | No - Hotfix ready |

## Post-Testing Actions
1. Document all issues found
2. Prioritize fixes
3. Re-test critical fixes
4. Prepare hotfix branch
5. Brief support team
6. Monitor early adopters
