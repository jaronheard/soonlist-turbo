```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaronheard/soonlist-turbo.git
cd soonlist-turbo
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Setup environment variables

You'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and an `.env.production file` in the root of the project. Contact @jaronheard for the values for these files.

## Local webhooks

A webhook server for the development environment is deployed to Vercel. No local development webhook server is needed.

```bash
pnpm studio
```

This will start the Drizzle Studio, allowing you to interact with the database.
