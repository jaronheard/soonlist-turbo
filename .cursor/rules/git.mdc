# Git Workflow

## Branch Rules

- Never commit to main
- Never push to origin/main
- Create descriptive branch names (e.g., `add-event-sharing`, `fix-screenshot-parsing`)
- Pull latest main before creating a new branch

## Commit Process

1. Run checks: `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm format:fix && pnpm check`
2. Commit with clear messages describing what changed
3. Commit often as you work

## Creating PRs

1. Push branch to GitHub
2. Create PR using `gh pr create`
3. Use descriptive titles

## Terminal Commands

Always quote file paths - they may contain special characters:

```bash
# Correct
git diff "apps/expo/src/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx"

# Wrong - will fail on parentheses
git diff apps/expo/src/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx
```
