# React Patterns

## Components

- Functional components only
- Named exports preferred
- File structure: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Check for existing UI components in `packages/ui/` before creating new ones

## Hooks

- Question if `useEffect` is needed - only use for syncing with external systems
- Prefer React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for external system sync
- Convex handles data fetching, caching, and state management
- Avoid premature `useMemo`/`useCallback` optimization

## Error Handling

- Early returns and guard clauses
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
- Error boundaries for unexpected errors

## Styling

- Web: Shadcn UI, Radix, and TailwindCSS
- Mobile: NativeWind (TailwindCSS for React Native)
- Mobile-first responsive design
