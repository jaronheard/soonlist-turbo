        <h1>Privacy Policy for Soonlist</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 7, 2025</p>
        <p>
          At Soonlist ("we," "us," or "our"), accessible from
          https://www.soonlist.com, one of our main priorities is the privacy of
          our visitors and users. This Privacy Policy document contains details
          about the types of information that Soonlist collects and records via
          our website and our iOS application ("App"), as well as how we use and
          protect that information. By using our website or iOS App, you hereby
          consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to the terms herein.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have additional questions or require more information about our
          Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.

        <h2>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to information collected online through
          the Soonlist website and through our iOS App. It does not apply to any
          information collected offline or via channels other than this website
          or our iOS App.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
        <h3>A. Website Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          Soonlist follows a standard procedure of using log files for the
          website. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All
          hosting companies do this as part of hosting services' analytics. The
          information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP)
          addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and
          time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks.
          These are not linked to any information that is personally
          identifiable. The purpose of the information is to analyze trends,
          administer the site, track users' movement on the website, and gather
          demographic information.
        </p>
        <h3>B. iOS App Data Collection</h3>
