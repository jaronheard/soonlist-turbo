        <h2>1. THE APPLICATION</h2>
        <p>
          Soonlist ("Licensed Application") is a piece of software created so
          people can easily capture, organize, and share potential events they
          want to attend â€” and customized for iOS mobile devices ("Devices"). It
          is used to help users save event details (from websites, flyers,
          screenshots), quickly add them to their calendars, and share events
          and lists with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Licensed Application is not tailored to comply with
          industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, FISMA, etc.), so if your
          interactions would be subject to such laws, you may not use this
          Licensed Application. You may not use the Licensed Application in a
          way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
        </p>

        <h2>2. SCOPE OF LICENSE</h2>
        <p>
          2.1 You are given a non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable
          license to install and use the Licensed Application on any Devices
          that You (End-User) own or control and as permitted by the Usage
          Rules, except that the Licensed Application may be accessed and used
          by other accounts associated with You via Family Sharing or volume
          purchasing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 This license will also govern any updates of the Licensed
          Application provided by Licensor that replace, repair, and/or
          supplement the first Licensed Application, unless a separate license
          is provided for such update, in which case the terms of that new
          license will govern.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 You may not share or make the Licensed Application available to
          third parties (unless allowed by the Usage Rules and with Soonlist
          Company's prior written consent), sell, rent, lend, lease, or
          otherwise redistribute the Licensed Application.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 You may not reverse engineer, translate, disassemble, integrate,
          decompile, remove, modify, combine, create derivative works or updates
          of, adapt, or attempt to derive the source code of the Licensed
          Application, or any part thereof (except with Soonlist Company's prior
          written consent).
        </p>
        <p>
          2.5 You may not copy (except when expressly authorized by this license
          and the Usage Rules) or alter the Licensed Application or portions
          thereof. You may create and store copies only on Devices you own or
          control for backup keeping, under the terms of this license, the Usage
          Rules, and any other terms and conditions that apply to the device or
          software used. You may not remove any intellectual property notices.
          You acknowledge that no unauthorized third parties may gain access to
          these copies at any time. If you sell your Devices to a third party,
          you must remove the Licensed Application from the Devices before doing
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.6 Violations of the obligations mentioned above, as well as attempts
          to do so, may be subject to prosecution and damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.7 Licensor reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of
          licensing.
        </p>

          ensure that You comply with applicable third-party terms and
          conditions.
